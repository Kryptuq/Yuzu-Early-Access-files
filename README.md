yuzu The Nintendo Switch Emulator
=============
[![Appveyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/MostlyWhat/yuzu-early-access?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MostlyWhat/yuzu-early-access)

yuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch from the creators of [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/).

It is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows and Linux. The emulator is capable of running several commercial games.

yuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore most commercial games **do not** run at full speed or are not fully functional.
